This project reflects my learning of various concepts of React.
It serves as the introduction towards my journey in React. 

This specific project covers these topics:

1) React and its components, and how ReactDOM is responsible to show those changes on the web.

2) Props, and how to transfer data between parent to child

3) useState hook and how it is used to manage states in React.

4) Rendering of lists, and lifiting up states

and various other concepts, but these are the main ones.
